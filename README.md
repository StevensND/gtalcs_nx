<h1 align=center>GTA: Liberty City Stories - Nintendo Switch port</h1>

This is a wrapper/port of the Android version of Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories (v2.4.379).
It loads the original game binary, patches it and runs it.
It's basically as if we emulate a minimalist Android environment in which we natively run the original Android binary as is.

### How to install

You're going to need:
* the `.apk` for version **2.4.379**

To install:
1. Create a folder called `gtalcs` in the `switch` folder on your SD card.
2. Extract `assets/data_main.wad` and `assets/data_music.wad` to `/switch/gtalcs/`.
3. Extract `lib/arm64-v8a/libGame.so` **and** `lib/arm64-v8a/libopenal.so` from the `arm64-v8a`
   APK to `/switch/gtalcs/`.
4. Extract `res\raw\intro.m4v` to `/switch/gtalcs/`.
5. Copy `gtalcs_nx.nro` into `/switch/gtalcs/`.

Your SD card should contain: `/switch/gtalcs/gtalcs_nx.nro`, `/switch/gtalcs/libGame.so`,
`/switch/gtalcs/libopenal.so`, `/switch/gtalcs/data_main.wad` `/switch/gtalcs/data_music.wad`
and `/switch/gtalcs/intro.m4v`

### Notes

This will not work in applet/album mode. Use a game override (hold R on a title) or a forwarder.

Save games and settings are stored in `/switch/gtalcs/`.

The port has an extra config file, located at `/switch/gtalcs/config.txt`. It is created when you
first run the game:
* `screen_width` / `screen_height` — render resolution; `-1` picks 1280x720 in handheld and 1920x1080 docked
* `trilinear_filter` — `1` forces trilinear texture filtering
* `show_fps` — `1` draws a small FPS counter in the top left corner

### How to build

You're going to need devkitA64 and the following packages/libraries:
* `switch-mesa`
* `switch-libdrm_nouveau`
* `switch-sdl2`
* `switch-mpg123`
* `switch-ffmpeg`
* `switch-openal-soft`
* `devkitpro-pkgbuild-helpers`
